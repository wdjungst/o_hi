Collaboration points based to-do list

set up navigatoin, adam is working on this.  just a basic menu, left to right,
  at the top of the screen.  so far i am thinking tasks or whatever,
  points or whatever and add a whatever.

set up partials for ticket, points graph, and all the other things whatever.
  this is borked because it can't find the helper.  this is a carbon copy for
  a working model on stack overflow, in formatting.  wtf, dude?
